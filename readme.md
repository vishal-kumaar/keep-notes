# Keep Notes
This is a Notes Making Web Application. This is a useful static website for making short notes like Google Notes.<br>
> We use,
>- `HTML`
>- `Bootstrap`
>- `Javascript`<br>
>
>for making this beautifull note making website.<br>

For `Fonts` and `Icon` I use [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com 'Click Me').<br>
> This Magic Notes Web Application have many fuctionality like,
> - `Search`
> - `Mark any notes as Important`
> - `Delete any notes if you note want`

Also, I use `local storage` of our browser to save our notes.<br>

So, be careful and you don't need to clear your `local storage`  of this website in your browser because if you do that then all your notes will be cleared.<br>

*If you want to do that then, write below code on your browser console to clear your local storage:*
```Javascript
localstorge.clear();
```
